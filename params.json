What's the caveats for using LASSO? Unstableness in multi-colinearity and estimation bais due to the penalty term. \r\n\r\nNonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP are statistically better but computationally harder. The solution for SCAD/MCP penalized linear model has much less estimation error than lasso but unfortunately there hasn't been any reliable solver for people to use so far.\r\n\r\nThe PICASSO package solves non-convex optimization through multi-stage convex relaxation. Although we only find a local minimum, it can be proved that this local minimum does not lose the superior statistcal property of the global minimu.\r\n\r\n## Fast and stable\r\n\r\nAs a traditional LASSO solver, our package is as fast as the state-of-the-art glmnet solver. For SCAD regularzied linear/logistic regression, it can be shown that our package is much faster and more stable than the alternative ncvreg.\r\n\r\nFor the experiments, we use sample number n = 2000 and sample dimension d = 1000. The parameter c is used to control the column-wise correlation of the desgin matrix X.\r\n\r\nTiming for L1 regularized linear regression.\r\n\r\n|         |  c=0.1   |  c=0.5   |    c= 1.0    |\r\n| :-----: | :------: | :------: | :----------: |\r\n| PICASSO | 0.296(s) | 0.365(s) |   0.575(s)   |\r\n| glmnet  | 0.276(s) | 0.297(s) |   0.445(s)   |\r\n| ncvreg  | 0.318(s) | 1.818(s) | 9.429(s) [*] |\r\n\r\n'[*]': Package exited with warning: Algorithm failed to converge for some values of lambda.\r\n\r\nTiming for SCAD regularized linear regression.\r\n\r\n|         | c = 0.1  | c = 0.5  |   c = 1.0    |\r\n| :-----: | :------: | :------: | :----------: |\r\n| PICASSO | 0.446(s) | 0.445(s) |   0.712(s)   |\r\n| ncvreg  | 0.374(s) | 0.405(s) | 2.177(s) [*] |\r\n\r\n'[*]': Package exited with warning: Algorithm failed to converge for some values of lambda.\r\n\r\nTiming for SCAD regularized logistic regression\r\n\r\n|         |   c = 0.1    | c = 0.5  | c = 1.0 |\r\n| :-----: | :----------: | :------: | :-----: |\r\n| PICASSO |   1.016(s)   | 0.528(s) |  0.503  |\r\n| ncvreg  | 3.104(s) [*] | 2.778(s) |  5.862  |\r\n\r\n'[*]': Package exited with warning: Algorithm failed to converge for some values of lambda.\r\n\r\n",
